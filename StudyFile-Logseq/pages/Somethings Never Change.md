- ### Lyrics
	- ANNA：
	  Yes the wind blows a little bit colder
	  And we're all getting older
	  And the clouds are moving on with every autumn breeze
	  Peter Pumpkin just became fertilizer
	- OLAF：
	  And my leaf's a little sadder and wiser
	- ANNA：
	  That's why I rely on certain certainties
	  Yes some things never change
	  Like the feel of your hand in mine
	  Some things stay the same
	- ANNA/OLAF：
	  Like how we get along just fine
	- ANNA：
	  Like an old stone wall that'll never fall
	  Some things are always true
	  Some things never change
	  Like how I'm holding on tight to you
	- KRISTOFF：
	  The leaves are already falling
	  Sven it feels like the future is calling
	  Are you telling me tonight you're gonna get down on one knee
	  Yeah bud I'm really bad at planning these things out
	  Like candlelight and pulling of rings out
	  Maybe you should leave all the romantic stuff to me
	  Yeah some things never change
	  Like the love that I feel for her
	  Some things stay the same
	  Like how reindeers are easier
	  But if I commit and I go for it
	  I'll know what to say and do
	  Right
	  Some things never change
	  Sven the pressure is all on you
	- ELSA：
	  The winds are restless
	  Could that be why I'm hearing this call
	  Is something coming
	  I'm not sure I want things to change at all
	  These days are precious
	  Can't let them slip away
	  I can't freeze this moment
	  But I can still go out and seize this day
	  Ah ah ah ah ah ah
	  The wind blows a little bit colder
	- OLAF：
	  And you all look a little bit older
	- ANNA：
	  It's time to count our blessings
	- ANNA/KRISTOFF：
	  Beneath an autumn sky
	  We're always living the kingdom aplenty
	  That stands for the good and the many
	- ELSA：
	  And I promise you the flag of Arendelle will always fly
	- ANNA：
	  Our flag will always fly
	  Our flag will always fly
	  Our flag will always fly
	- Both：
	  Some things never change
	  Turn around and the time has flown
	  Some things stay the same
	  Though the future remains unknown
	  May our good luck last
	  May our past be past
	  Time's moving fast it's true
	  Some things never change
	- ANNA：
	  And I'm holding on tight to you
	- ELSA：
	  Holding on tight to you
	- OLAF：
	  Holding on tight to you
	- KRISTOFF：
	  Holding on tight to you
	- ANNA：
	  I'm holding on tight to you
